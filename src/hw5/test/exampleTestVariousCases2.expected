# generic version-Jun Wang 5:00
# Sample testing case2-two edges.
# Tests that a graph can be created, a pair of nodes and
# an edge between them can be added, and a pair of nodes
# and a single edge can be printed out.


# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n2 to n1 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1, n2
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1)
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1(e2)
