# Sample testing case2-two edges.
# Tests that a graph can be created, a pair of nodes and
# an edge between them can be added, and a pair of nodes
# and a single edge can be printed out.


# Create a graph
CreateGraph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
AddNode graph1 n1
AddNode graph1 n2

# Add edges
AddEdge graph1 n1 n2 e1
AddEdge graph1 n2 n1 e2

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1, n2
