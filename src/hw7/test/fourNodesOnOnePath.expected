# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when there is only one possible path with 4 nodes hw7

created graph g
added node A to g
added node B to g
added node C to g
added node D to g
added edge 0.500 from A to B in g
added edge 0.800 from B to D in g
added edge 1.000 from D to C in g

path from A to C:
A to B with weight 0.500
B to D with weight 0.800
D to C with weight 1.000
total cost: 2.300
