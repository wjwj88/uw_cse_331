Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from HW5 and why 
those changes were made below.  (See the HW6 assignment for details.)

1. I created a new class EdgesOfNode.java for HW 5, which is an object to store an edge with its destination,
   because I initially uses HashMap<destination, edge> which turned out to be very time consuming.
2. I changed the data structure for storing the node and destination associated with edges from 
   HashMap<String, ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>>> to HashMap<String, Set<EdgesOfNode>> because 
   it turned out that Set is more efficient and faster than ArrayList in terms of storing the nodes 
   and the associated edges. Otherwise, the time required to create the graph will be much more than 
   30s.
3. Due to the above 2 changes, I also wrote a test file to test EdgesOfNode.java.
4. Since the data structure of the DiGraph was changed, I made some small changes in the methods
   in DiGraph.java class to match Set instead of ArrayList. I also deleted some methods which are not
   necessary for hw5 and hw6.
5. For hw5, I need to use the comparator defined in hw6 class and I already import hw6 in hw5 files.
6. The main method in the PathFinder.java in hw6 is already tested by myself but no tests file were written
   due to the System.out.println(). It can be tested by running it through attu command line if necessary.
7. The new hw5 graph class and hw6 PathFinder class had passed all tests, including hw5 tests and hw6 tests.
