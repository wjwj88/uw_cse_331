Describe which parts of your code belong to the model, the view,
the controller, or none of these.  (See the assignment for details.)

model: NodeCoordinate.java, CampusParser.java, CampusPathFinderModel.java

The campusViewController.java is a combination of view and controller.
The methods can be listed as below:
printBuildings(), printMenu(), printRoute() methods are view because they are 
used to show information to the user
The main method in this class is mainly a controller since it takes
the input from the user. However, it has some view inside because 
when the user wants to print some appropriate information, it will 
call print methods mentioned above which are view.
